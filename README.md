The Task Manager program is a simple Python application designed to help users manage their tasks. It allows users to perform basic operations such as adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, removing tasks, and viewing all tasks.
Title: Exploring Python Programming: Task Manager and Guessing Game

Abstract:
This report delves into the implementation and functionality of two Python programs: a task manager and a guessing game. These programs serve as introductory examples for Python programming, illustrating fundamental concepts such as classes, loops, conditional statements, and input/output handling. The report provides an in-depth analysis of each program, including its features, implementation details, usage instructions, and example interactions.

1. Introduction:
Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is an excellent choice for beginners due to its easy-to-understand syntax and extensive standard library. This report focuses on two Python programs that showcase the language's capabilities: a task manager and a guessing game.

2. Task Manager Program:
The Task Manager program allows users to manage their tasks effectively. It offers functionalities such as adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, removing tasks, and viewing all tasks. The program is implemented using a class named `TaskManager`, encapsulating task management operations.

2.1 Features:
Add Task: Users can add tasks to the task list by providing a description.
Complete Task: Tasks can be marked as completed, updating their status.
Remove Task: Users can remove tasks from the task list based on the task index.
Show Tasks: All tasks and their completion status are displayed to the user.

2.2 Implementation:
The `TaskManager` class stores tasks as dictionaries with keys for the task description and completion status. The main program loop presents a menu interface to users, allowing them to choose from various options. Input validation is implemented to handle invalid user inputs gracefully.

2.3 Usage:
Upon running the program, users are presented with a menu where they can perform different tasks. They can add tasks, mark tasks as completed or remove them, and view all tasks along with their completion status. Example interactions demonstrate the program's functionality and ease of use.

3. Guessing Game Program:
The Guessing Game is an interactive game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The computer provides hints to guide the player towards the correct answer, making the game more engaging.

3.1 Features:
Random Number Generation: The computer generates a random number within a specified range (the the default is between 1 and 100).
Guessing Mechanism: Players input their guesses, and the computer provides hints (too high or too low) based on the guess.
Game Loop: The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number.
Play Again Option: After each game, the player can choose to play again or exit the program.

3.2 Implementation:
The game logic is encapsulated in a `guessing_game()` function, which handles random number generation, player guesses, hint provision, and game loop management. Input validation ensures that the player's input is within the acceptable range and format.

3.3 Usage:
Players are prompted to guess the secret number generated by the computer. They input their guesses, and the computer provides hints to guide them. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number, after which they can choose to play again or exit.

4. Example Interactions:
Example interactions demonstrate how users interact with each program. In the Task Manager program, users can add tasks, mark tasks as completed, remove tasks, and view all tasks. In the Guessing Game program, players guess the secret number generated by the computer, receiving hints until they guess correctly.

5. Conclusion:
The Task Manager and Guessing Game programs provide simple yet effective examples of Python programming. They demonstrate fundamental concepts such as classes, loops, conditional statements, and input/output handling in a practical context. These programs serve as excellent introductory exercises for beginners learning Python programming and showcase the language's versatility and ease of use.

6. Future Enhancements:
The Task Manager program could be expanded to include features such as task prioritization, due dates, and task categories.
The Guessing Game program could be improved with additional gameplay elements, such as multiple difficulty levels, scoring, and a graphical user interface.
